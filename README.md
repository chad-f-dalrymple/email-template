Download the project folder. You can either open the index file or if you use a package manager, you can build the project in the terminal. 

If you're using NPM: npm start to run the project. A new browser window will open with a BrowserSync server showing the finished files.

Run npm run build to do a full email inlining process.

If you're using Yarn: Do the same but replace NPM with Yarn.
